        "paragraph1": "\"Antura Christianity\" was launched in 2009 as a TV show based on 2 Peter 3:15. This service was a program that was presented on Elshadai television for four consecutive years, and it was started mainly to answer questions about Christianity.",
        "paragraph2": "During this ministry, when it saw the problems in various churches, it realized that the problems were vast and complex. Based on this situation, through prayer and consultation with a few of it friends, it came to the conclusion that if the church needs to bring lasting change to itself and the community, it should focus on young adults (15-17 years old).",
        "paragraph3": "It believed that in order for these young people to be influential, they need holistic support from the family, the church, and the ministries. Therefore, the service started in 2011 by accepting 11 students for a one-year \"Basic Apologetics\" and teaching them and holding various seminars and discussions. It currently has four full-time employees and the learning centers have grown to two. The enrollment capacity has increased to fifty students."
